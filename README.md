# Carrier-catapults

This adds a limited, sorta-realistic carrier catapult system to GeoFS.

To use this addon, copy the contents of "Working catapult code.js" and paste it into the console. You will get ui.notifications (not desktop notifications) on the bottom of the GeoFS UI telling you how to use the addon.
"BTE experimental catapults.js" is the WIP script for implementation into the BTE addon.
